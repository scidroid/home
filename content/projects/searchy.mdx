Searchy is an innovative telecommunications project powered by Twilio, designed to bridge the digital divide by providing up-to-date information to those without internet access. This unique phone line service utilizes a voice prompt system with natural language, enabling users to make a call and receive accurate, current information irrespective of their online connectivity. It is an inclusive solution to an increasingly digital world, ensuring that crucial information is accessible to everyone, regardless of their technological resources.

The project is particularly relevant in regions like Colombia, where approximately 80% of farming families lack internet access. These communities, often considered vulnerable due to their limited access to digital infrastructure, are the primary beneficiaries of Searchy. This service allows them to stay informed about critical factors affecting their livelihood, such as weather updates, market prices, agricultural tips, and more. With Searchy, farmers can effectively navigate their industry's challenges and optimize their agricultural practices, even in the absence of internet connectivity.
