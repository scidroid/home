AgroScan is a progressive web application that allows farmers to take a photo of their cocoa plants, which is then analyzed by the app's on-device AI algorithm, providing a real-time diagnostic report on potential health issues. This timely identification and resolution of problems not only improves crop health and yield but also prevents the widespread of diseases.

The development of AgroScan was triggered by the challenges confronted by cacao farmers in conflict-affected regions of Colombia, where cacao cultivation is often one alternative amidst prevalent violence and insecurity. However, crop diseases pose a significant threat, affecting their operations' sustainability and causing potential crop losses. AgroScan serves as a vital tool for these farmers, aiding in disease identification and management, thereby bolstering their chances of success and fostering long-term sustainability in these regions.
